                                adopted a popular mode named SaaS that users can conveniently use all kinds of 
                                functions purchased from the cloud platform. Customers of restaurants ordered food 
                                just by tapping smart terminals or scanning a QR code on each table, and finally finish 
                                payments by WeChat or Alipay. Besides, managers can manage categories, manage 
                                shops, manage terminals and view sale statistics and trend charts and so on.

							<p>QQ Dragon 1 was a hardcore MMORPG in the era of kjava feature phones, which took 
                                a well-known Chinese ancient fairy tale named LiaoZhai as the background. 
                                The game server, based on the Linux and open-source projects, such as MySQL and 
                                memcache, contained Game Server, Account Server, Role Server, Consignment Server, 
                                Payment Server and so on. In that time, regarding low performance of feature phones, 
                                we managed to contract the kjava application package of the game client to under 
                                1MB. Because of creative play methods and fine scenes, the game was popular in 
                                China.

                                because of its unhealthy structure and heavy front-end which was achieved by a java 
                                client, there were a lot of bugs, some even cannot be fixed in allocated time, and it is 
                                difficult to add new features at all. I reconstructed the whole design by altering CS 
                                structure to BS which is more suitable for complex and rapidly upgraded business 
                                models. Until now, the system is running smoothly.
