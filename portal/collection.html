							<p>The system was to provide an online service to restaurant businessmen to cut down

                                adopted a popular mode named SaaS that users can conveniently use all kinds of 
                                functions purchased from the cloud platform. Customers of restaurants ordered food 
                                just by tapping smart terminals or scanning a QR code on each table, and finally finish 
                                payments by WeChat or Alipay. Besides, managers can manage categories, manage 
                                shops, manage terminals and view sale statistics and trend charts and so on.

                                Our team managed to reconstruct the whole framework, adopt more elaborate UI, 
                                scenes and figures, and create more interesting play methods.

                                to 45%, as well as both stability and maintainability are outstanding. As a result, I was

                                a well-known Chinese ancient fairy tale named LiaoZhai as the background. 
                                The game server, based on the Linux and open-source projects, such as MySQL and 
                                memcache, contained Game Server, Account Server, Role Server, Consignment Server, 
                                Payment Server and so on. In that time, regarding low performance of feature phones, 
                                we managed to contract the kjava application package of the game client to under 
                                1MB. Because of creative play methods and fine scenes, the game was popular in

                                client, there were a lot of bugs, some even cannot be fixed in allocated time, and it is 
                                difficult to add new features at all. I reconstructed the whole design by altering CS 
                                structure to BS which is more suitable for complex and rapidly upgraded business 
                                models. Until now, the system is running smoothly.

							<h3><b>VOIP Soft Switch Platform<br>(Centnet 2005-2007)</b></h3>
							<p>The platform, running on Linux, was the central server of the VOIP solution that 
                                handles H.264 protocol signal commands and transfers voice data stream to realize 
                                communicating through the internet network, just like the Skype server. It contained 
                                Soft Switch Server, Smart Billing Server, Endpoint Management Server and EasyTrans 
                                Server, and all endpoint devices (voice gateway) that connects a certain number of 
                                traditional phones.
                            </p>

                                I developed core functions of the system and reconstructed Smart Billing Server to 
                                make it running as BS mode which is easier to be maintained and upgraded.

							<h3><b>EasyTrans Server<br>(Centnet 2004-2006)</b></h3>
							<p>EasyTrans, short for Easily Transferring, was a relay server for large concurrent voice 
                                data stream during VOIP communication, making gateways located in LAN 
                                communicate smoothly with VOIP servers across all kinds of firewalls. Due to the 
                                limited volume of traditional approach through the Linux application layer, a single 
                                server could not support enough channels. By contrast, the EasyTrans server handled 
                                data in the kernel layer of Linux, which made it much more efficient, so the capacity of 
                                a single server increased by 400%.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I designed and developed EasyTrans Server, lifting server capacity from 200 channels 
                                to 1000 in a single server. Finally, its realization method obtained a China National 
                                Patent.
