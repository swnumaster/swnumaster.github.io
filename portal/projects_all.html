							<h3><b class="highlight">QQ DRAGON 1<br>(Tencent 2011-2013)</b></h3>
							<p>QQ Dragon 1 was a hardcore MMORPG set in the era of KJava feature phones, with a background based on a well-known Chinese ancient fairy tale named LiaoZhai. The game servers, including Game, Account, Role, Consignment, and Payment Servers, were based on open-source projects such as Linux, MySQL, and Memcache. Despite the low performance of feature phones at the time, we managed to contract the KJava application package of the game client to under 1MB. With creative gameplay methods and high-quality scenes, QQ Dragon 1 quickly became popular in China.

							<h3><b class="highlight">CUSTOMER SERVICE SYSTEM<br>(Tencent 2007-2008)</b></h3>
							<p>The Customer Service System is an essential part of Tencent's infrastructure, connecting millions of users with the company's customer service staff. Due to the vast scale of Tencent's operations and the complexity of its business, the system is designed with several layers, from the load-balancer (nginx) and web server (Apache) to the web (PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML), webservice (PHP, JSON), BO (PHP), DAO (PHP), database (MySQL), and cache (Memcache). Each layer is carefully crafted to ensure the system runs smoothly, with optimized performance and high reliability.

                            <p>When I joined Tencent, the platform had already been running for several years. However, it had an unhealthy structure and heavy front-end that was implemented by a Java client. As a result, there were many bugs, some of which couldn't be fixed within the allocated time, and it was difficult to add new features. I reconstructed the entire design by changing the Client-Server (CS) structure to a Browser-Server (BS) structure, which is more suitable for complex and rapidly evolving business models. Thanks to these changes, the system is now running smoothly.

							<p>EasyTrans, which stands for Easily Transferring, was a relay server designed to handle large concurrent voice data streams during VOIP communication. It allowed gateways located in LAN to communicate smoothly with VOIP servers across all kinds of firewalls. The traditional approach through the Linux application layer had a limited volume, which meant that a single server could not support enough channels. However, EasyTrans processed data in the kernel layer of Linux, which significantly improved efficiency and increased the capacity of a single server by 400%.
