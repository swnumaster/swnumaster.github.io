                                EasyTrade is an e-commerce website. I decoupled the system into web front-end (React, JavaScript), webservice back-end
                                (Flask, python) and storage layer (MySQL, Redis). The back-end supplies RESTful APIs supporting JSON data. This solution 
                                can support all types of front-end, such as web, mobile native applications and WeChat mini programs. In the future, the 
                                system will be optimized into micro-services and hosted in Docker containers and managed by Kubernetes.

							<h3><b class="highlight">SELF-SERVICE ORDERING SYSTEM<br>(Chueasy Studio 2016-2019)</b></h3>
							<p>The system was to provide an online service to restaurant businessmen to cut down

                                adopted a popular mode named SaaS that users can conveniently use all kinds of 
                                functions purchased from the cloud platform. Customers of restaurants ordered food 
                                just by tapping smart terminals or scanning a QR code on each table, and finally finish 
                                payments by WeChat or Alipay. Besides, managers can manage categories, manage 
                                shops, manage terminals and view sale statistics and trend charts and so on.

							<p>QQ Dragon 1 was a hardcore MMORPG in the era of kjava feature phones, which took 
                                a well-known Chinese ancient fairy tale named LiaoZhai as the background. 
                                The game server, based on the Linux and open-source projects, such as MySQL and 
                                memcache, contained Game Server, Account Server, Role Server, Consignment Server, 
                                Payment Server and so on. In that time, regarding low performance of feature phones, 
                                we managed to contract the kjava application package of the game client to under 
                                1MB. Because of creative play methods and fine scenes, the game was popular in 
                                China.
